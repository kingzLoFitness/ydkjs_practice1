# You Don't Know JavaScript Up and Going - Practice 1

This is my version of creation.  It has a few functions and a function calling a function from within it.  My level with JavaScript is a little above beginner in that sense from practicals within other tutorials such as Codeacademy.

## What's next?

I'm looking to create this in a real world environment.  What I mean by that?  As my skills increase I shall put this .js file as an external script within a .html file and have a creation where the end user can go through the prompts and the result will show up on the screen vs. having to go through console for output or annoying alert messages.
